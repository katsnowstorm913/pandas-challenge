# pandas-challenge
This project uses jupyter notebook and pandas to turn a csv file of purchase data for 
a game (containing purchase ID, screen name, age, gender,item puchased(id and name), 
and the price for each purchase made) into a data frame. It then breaks it down into 
smaller summary data frames to better anyalyse the data. These smaller data frames 
sumarize the number of players that have made purchases, total purchase analysis (breaks 
down number of unique items, average purchase price, total purchases, and total revenue), 
gender and demographics, purchase analysis broken down by both gender and age, the games 
top spenders, most popular items, and most profitable items.
